## Explanation of PDFs
### Lab_Report.pdf
This document provides an in-depth lab report on the PCB design process. It covers the complete workflow, including:
- **General Design Flow**: Steps from request and specification to testing and delivery.
- **Circuit Development**: Breakdown of power, digital, and analog components.
- **KiCad Implementation**: Creating schematics, choosing components, and PCB routing.
- **Design Principles**: Emphasizes key concepts like Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Law, and transmission line theory.
- **Conclusion**: Summarizes the learnings and challenges of the PCB design process.

### co-527-manual.pdf
A comprehensive manual for the CO-527 component, including:
- Specifications and features of the CO-527 component.
- Guidelines for its integration and usage in PCB design.
- Example use cases and performance benchmarks.

## File Formats
- **`.kicad_sch`**: Schematic files containing circuit diagrams for PCB designs in KiCad.
- **`.kicad_pcb`**: PCB layout files used in KiCad PCB design software.
- **`.kicad_pro`**: KiCad project files that organize all design files into a single project.
- **`fp-info-cache`**: Cache file containing footprint data for the project.
- **`.pdf`**: Portable Document Format files for lab reports and manuals.
- **`.zip`**: Archived backups of project files for versioning and recovery.

## Usage
1. Open the KiCad project file (`.kicad_pro`) to access the schematic and PCB layout.
2. Use the `.pdf` files for reference and additional documentation.
3. Explore the backup folder for alternative or previous versions of the schematic.
